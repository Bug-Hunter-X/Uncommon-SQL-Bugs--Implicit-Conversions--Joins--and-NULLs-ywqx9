In SQL, a common mistake is to use implicit data type conversions.  For example, comparing a string column to a numeric value without explicit casting can lead to unexpected results and incorrect query output. This can occur silently because SQL might try to convert types implicitly, which could lead to unexpected boolean results or errors. Consider the scenario where you have a column 'id' which is varchar and you try to compare it with an integer without a cast, like 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = 1'. If 'id' contains values that look numeric but are strings (e.g., '1', '2'), SQL might attempt to cast 'id' to integer on a per row basis. But if 'id' has a non-numeric value like 'abc' then conversion will fail and the query could produce unexpected results (such as an implicit conversion error, or simply unexpected boolean results).

Another problem can arise with implicit joins. If you don't specify the join condition clearly, SQL might perform a Cartesian product (joining every row from one table with every row from another), which can be inefficient and return a massive dataset that is hard to manage.  A classic case would be forgetting an ON clause in a JOIN statement resulting in a large, unusable dataset.

Finally, neglecting to handle NULL values properly is a pitfall. NULLs can cause unexpected behavior in comparisons (NULL = NULL is typically false; NULL > 5 is also false, etc.).  Using IS NULL or IS NOT NULL is important for correct querying where NULL values might exist in your tables.
